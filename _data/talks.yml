      title: " Enhancing Radar-based Sensing with RF Backscatter Tags"
      abstract: "We
need affordable and innovative sensing to assist in tackling global-scale problems. Radars have become a common tool in sensing applications. However, target detection and identification remain challenges. This talk presents our system that combines RF backscatter
tags with commodity UWB radar to cooperatively detect and identify objects in realtime. Our approach makes existing sensing applications, like localization, significantly easier, as well as enabling novel applications. I describe how even in cluttered static
environments without line-of-sight, the return amplitude of our backscatter tags can be 100-10,000x larger than the strongest noise signal. I will also present two example applications we implemented to demonstrate the potential of our system: soil moisture
sensing and respiration monitoring."

      title: "Heterogeneity-Aware Cluster Scheduling Policies for Deep Learning Workloads"
      abstract: " Specialized accelerators such as GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, and custom ASICs have been increasingly deployed to train deep learning models. These accelerators exhibit heterogeneous performance behavior across model architectures. Existing schedulers for clusters of accelerators, which are used to arbitrate these expensive training resources across many users, have shown how to optimize for various multi-job, multi-user objectives, like fairness and makespan. Unfortunately, existing schedulers largely do not consider performance heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose Gavel, a heterogeneity-aware scheduler that systematically generalizes a wide range of existing scheduling policies. Gavel expresses these policies as optimization problems and then systematically transforms these problems into heterogeneity-aware versions using an abstraction we call effective throughput. Gavel then uses a round-based scheduling mechanism to ensure jobs receive their ideal allocation given the target scheduling policy. Gavel's heterogeneity-aware policies allow a heterogeneous cluster to sustain higher input load, and improve end objectives such as makespan and average job completion time by 1.4x and 3.5x compared to heterogeneity-agnostic policies."
